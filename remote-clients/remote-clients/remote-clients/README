Titanium Cloud Remote CLI Clients
----------------------------------

To enable access to the Titanium Cloud CLI remotely, clients and
installer script have been packaged for install on a remote Linux distribution.
This tarball includes several clients which can be used to issue CLI commands
to an existing Titanium Cloud.


Installing the Remote CLI Clients (system install)
--------------------------------------------------

To install the clients to the system packages on a Linux machine follow these
steps:

1.  Untar the provided tarball:
        tar xfv wrs-remote-clients-xxxVERSIONxxx.tgz
        cd wrs-remote-clients-xxxVERSIONxxx

2.  Execute the provided installer script:
        sudo ./install_clients.sh

NOTE: please open a new terminal after installing for the installed bash
      completion to take effect


Installing the Remote CLI Clients (virtualenv)
----------------------------------------------

To install the clients within an isolated virtualenv follow these steps:

1.  Create a virtualenv (if it does not already exist)
      virtualenv MYENV

2.  Activate the virtualenv
      source MYENV/bin/activate

3.  Untar the provided tarball:
      tar xfv wrs-remote-clients-xxxVERSIONxxx.tgz
      cd wrs-remote-clients-xxxVERSIONxxx

4.  Execute the provided installer script:
      ./install_clients.sh

5.  Remember to deactivate the virtualenv when you are finished using the
    remote clients.
      deactivate

6.  Run /etc/bash_completion to update bash completion, if your system
    supports it. You may need to do this when opening a new console as well.

Using the Remote CLI Clients
-----------------------------

1.  Download the openrc file from Horizon.
    Log in to horizon, go to:
    Project -> API Access -> Download OpenStack RC File

2.  On your console, source the file you have just downloaded.  You will be
    asked for your openstack password.  You will also be asked for an optional
    CA certificate.  Enter the path to your CA certificate used for Titanium
    Cloud if you have HTTPS configured. Press Enter if you are not using HTTPS

3   Run CLI commands in the same way you would run them on the Titanium
    Cloud Controller

NOTE: The open-source OpenStack CLI Clients can NOT be installed at the same
      time as the Titanium Cloud CLI Clients, however the Titanium Cloud CLI
      Clients can be used to manage an open-source OpenStack cloud by sourcing
      the appropriate openrc file for that cloud.

NOTE: The remote cli installer uses pip to install depdencies. The default pip
      package that comes with Ubuntu 16.04 has issues. Please upgrade pip to
      the 'latest' version before running the remote client installer if you
      are installing remote clients on a Ubuntu 16.04 system.
          pip install --upgrade pip
      Failure to do so can result in installation issues. The Ubuntu pip
      package issue is currently being tracked here
